            At Flowntasy Corp. (“Flowntasy” “we” or “us”), we are committed to
            protecting your privacy and keeping your information safe.
            Flowntasy processes information about you in a few different
            ways. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
            disclose and keep information that can identify you (“Personal
            Information”) when you create a Flowntasy account and use
            Flowntasy.com (the “Site”), or our mobile applications, to post
            content to the Flowntasy community, including stories you create,
            comments and messages (the “Services”).
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that our Terms of Service apply to this Privacy Policy. By
            creating an account with Flowntasy, using the Services, or
            submitting any Personal Information Information via the
            Services, you are consenting to the collection, use and
            disclosure of your Personal Information as described below in
            this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the use of your
            Personal Information in these ways, please stop using the
            Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is important; we hope you will take time to read it
            carefully.

            If you’re just browsing our Site, we don’t collect any Personal
            Information about you. In order for you to create an account
            with Flowntasy and use our Services, we need to collect and

            to anyone unless the data has been anonymized. For more

            Flowntasy account, you can always opt not to disclose any
            Personal Information to us, but then you may be unable to use
            certain features on the Services. For more information, visit

          <p>
            We use email as an important way to communicate with you. You
            can manage your email notification preferences, such as
            messages and follower alerts, by adjusting your preferences in
            the Notifications section of your account Settings. You may
            also opt out or unsubscribe from any future email
            communications from within a link provided in each email we
            send you. However, please note that in all cases you will
            continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding
            forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to
            our policies) from us.

            Our Services are designed to help you share information with
            the Flowntasy community. Any personal information that you
            voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area of
            the Service will be available to anyone who has access to that
            content (including other Flowntasy users), such as your username,
            name, the description you create, and your location, as well as
            the messages you post, whether on your profile, on our forums
            or to other users, and the lists you create, people you follow,
            stories you write, and many other bits of information that
            result from your use of the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use this information to make inferences, like what
            topics you may be interested in, to develop new products and
            services for the Flowntasy community, and to customize the
            content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost
            always to make the information you provide through Flowntasy
            public to the rest of the Flowntasy community, but we generally
            give you features, like direct messages, to make the
            information more private if you want.

            We may share your Personal Information with third-party service
            providers, but only where it’s necessary to provide any of the
            Services to you (e.g., email providers, server providers,

            users notice before Personal Information is transferred or
            becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

            privacy protections and the rights of authorities and

            They only employees who are granted access to your Personal
            Information are those with a business “need-to-know” or whose
            duties reasonably require such information. On all Flowntasy

            If you close your account, it will first be deactivated for a
            period of six months. When your account is deactivated, while
            it is not viewable on Flowntasy, all of your public contributions

            they will be anonymized).

            For six months after deactivation, it is still possible to
            restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully
            deactivated, including re-associating your comments and
            contributions to your profile. After six months, we permanently
            delete your Personal Information from our systems, except that
            your anonymized comments and contributions will remain on the
            Service.
